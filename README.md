## It's possible the index.html file in build got overwritten during the firebase init process. When that happens, firebase overwrites the files with its default template structures and hence the reason for that template. If the index.html file in the public folder still has required template, delete the build folder, alongside the files and folders generated by firebase(not really a requirement, but just to keep stuff cleaner and fresher) i.e .firebase folder, .firebaserc and firebase.json file, and then

* run `npm run build` or `yarn build`, depending on your package manager

* run `firebase login` and fill necessary requirements (skip if already logged in)

* select an existing firebase app or create a new one

* type `build` for the folder choice

* type/select `yes` for single page app option

* type/select `no` to avoid overwriting of files by firebase

* run `firebase serve --only hosting` for testing

* run `firebase deploy`
